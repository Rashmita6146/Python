#Data Type--> Data type is a kind of data variable can hold
#It has two types
 #1) Primitive data type-->Integer,float,string,boolean,set,none or null
 #2)Non-Primitive Data Type-->List, Tuple, Dictionary



Rashmita = 1  # This type is known as integer
Carlos = "Data Analyst"  #This type is known as string(collection of characters)
Karuna = 5.6  # This is a float type(decimal points)
Kiran = True  # This is boolean (It is a logical term which includes only true or false)
Y = [1,2,3,5]  # This is a list type (Collection of items which can be numerical or strings ) . It is mutable 
Vijaya = ("Apple", "Mango") # This is a tuple type (it is unmutable which means we cannot make any changes)
Santosh = {"Name": "Santosh"} # It is a dictionary data type. It can be numberic or string
